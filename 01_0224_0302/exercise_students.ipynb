        "3.  **Matplotlib** libary. It is used to create graphs and plots by using Python scripts. It has a module named pyplot (plt) which makes things easy for plotting by providing feature to control line styles, font properties, formatting axes etc.\n",
        "4. **Seaborn** library (sns). It is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
